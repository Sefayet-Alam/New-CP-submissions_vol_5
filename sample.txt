It’s a long-awaited post.
It’s been months of preparation for CodeSmash 2024: Intra RUET Fresher’s Programming Contest, and the journey finally reached its finish line.

This photo holds a touch of emotion — and marks the nearing end of a glorious chapter.
It’s been 3 years of being with RAPL, doing my part, however small, to contribute to this amazing community.

I had planned to deliver a heartfelt speech… but guess what? 🙂
It’s been so long since I gave a formal speech that I got nervous and completely forgot to thank the organizers properly on stage. 🙂

So, here's what I should’ve said:

💙 Huge thanks to the 22 series for organizing such a wonderful event! From problem setting to decorations, your enthusiasm and effort truly shone through.

💙 Grateful to the seniors for your constant guidance in managing every detail behind the scenes.

💙 21 series, thank you for the amazing help with problemset refinement — especially Labib, Arnob, and Wasimur, who practically pulled an all-nighter sorting the final order.

💙 Special thanks to Shoikat for helping me throughout the financial side of the contest — couldn't have handled it without you.

💙 And finally, Tausif and Suvro, you both gave more than 100% to make the event arrangement flawless.

And yeah — in the picture, that’s me trying to figure out how not to mess up the problemset analysis part. 😅
